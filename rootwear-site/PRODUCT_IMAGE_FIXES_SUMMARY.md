# Product Image Display Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the product image display issues in the RootWear e-commerce site. The primary issues were:

1. Products not showing images
2. Products incorrectly showing as "out of stock"

## Files Modified

1. **Components:**
   - `app/components/FeaturedProducts.js`
   - `app/products/page.js`
   - `app/products/[handle]/page.js`

2. **API Routes:**
   - `app/api/shopify/featured-products/route.js`

3. **New Files:**
   - `public/placeholder-product.svg`

## Key Changes

### 1. Error Handling

Added robust error handling for image loading failures in all components:

```javascript
onError={(e) => {
  e.target.src = '/placeholder-product.svg';
  console.error(`Failed to load image for product: ${product.title}`);
}}
```

### 2. Fallback Images

Created a consistent placeholder image and implemented fallback paths:

```javascript
src={image.url || image.src || '/placeholder-product.svg'}
```

### 3. Consistent Property Access

Updated all components to handle both `url` and `src` properties for images.

### 4. Availability Status

Verified and corrected availability status logic:

```javascript
availableForSale: product.variants.edges[0]?.node.availableForSale !== false
```

This ensures products are considered available unless explicitly marked as unavailable.

## Testing

A comprehensive test plan has been created to verify the fixes:

1. Featured Products Image Display
2. Products Page Image Display
3. Product Detail Page Image Display
4. Availability Status Display
5. Edge Case: Slow Network
6. Edge Case: Failed Image Requests

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience:** Users will always see either the product image or a branded placeholder
2. **Better Error Handling:** All image loading failures are now gracefully handled
3. **Consistent Fallbacks:** All components use the same placeholder image
4. **Easier Debugging:** Image loading failures are logged to the console

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Image Loading:** Watch for any image loading failures in production
2. **Optimize Images:** Consider implementing responsive images and lazy loading
3. **Enhance Error Reporting:** Add telemetry to track image loading failures
4. **Verify Shopify Data:** Ensure all product images are properly set in Shopify
