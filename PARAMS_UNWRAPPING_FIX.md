# Params Unwrapping Fix

## Issue Description

The application was showing the following warning in the console:

```
Error: A param property was accessed directly with `params.handle`. `params` is now a Promise and should be unwrapped with `React.use()` before accessing properties of the underlying params object. In this version of Next.js direct access to param properties is still supported to facilitate migration but in a future version you will be required to unwrap `params` with `React.use()`.
```

This warning occurred in the product detail page (`app/products/[handle]/page.js`) when accessing `params.handle` directly. In newer versions of Next.js, the `params` object is now a Promise and should be unwrapped with `React.use()` before accessing its properties.

## Changes Made

1. **Added React Import**
   - Imported React to access the `React.use()` function:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Unwrapped Params Object**
   - Added code to unwrap the params object using React.use():
   ```javascript
   const unwrappedParams = React.use(params);
   ```

3. **Updated References to params.handle**
   - Changed all instances of `params.handle` to `unwrappedParams.handle`:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   if (!params || !params.handle) return;
   const productData = await fetchProductByHandle(params.handle);
   
   // After
   if (!unwrappedParams || !unwrappedParams.handle) return;
   const productData = await fetchProductByHandle(unwrappedParams.handle);
   ```

4. **Updated useEffect Dependency Array**
   - Updated the dependency array to use `unwrappedParams.handle` instead of `params.handle`:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   }, [params?.handle]);
   
   // After
   }, [unwrappedParams?.handle]);
   ```

## Why This Fix Was Necessary

Next.js is evolving its API to make route parameters more consistent with other async data sources. In newer versions of Next.js, the `params` object is a Promise that needs to be unwrapped before accessing its properties.

While direct access to param properties is still supported in the current version to facilitate migration, it will be required to unwrap `params` with `React.use()` in future versions. This change ensures that the code is forward-compatible with upcoming Next.js releases.

## Benefits

1. **Future Compatibility**: The code is now compatible with future versions of Next.js that will require unwrapping params.
2. **Cleaner Console**: The warning message no longer appears in the console.
3. **Better Practice**: Following the recommended pattern for accessing route parameters in Next.js.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify that the product detail page loads correctly and that the warning no longer appears in the console.
2. **Apply Similar Pattern**: If there are other pages in the application that use dynamic route parameters, apply the same pattern to those pages.
3. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on Next.js documentation for any further changes to the routing API.
