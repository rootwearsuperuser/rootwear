# Changes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Replaced FeaturedProducts with SHOP NOW Button**
   - Removed the FeaturedProducts component from the homepage
   - Added a large, centered "SHOP NOW" button with terminal styling
   - Button links to the products page

2. **Fixed Async/Await Issue with params.handle**
   - Added check to ensure params.handle is available before using it
   - Updated dependency array to use optional chaining
   - This fixes the error: "Route '/products/[handle]' used `params.handle`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties."

3. **Investigated Duplicate Color Picker Issue**
   - Examined the product details page for duplicate color pickers
   - Found only one color selection UI section (lines 667-722)
   - No duplicate color picker was found in the code

## Changes Made

### 1. Homepage (app/page.js)

- Removed import for FeaturedProducts component
- Added import for Terminal icon and Link component
- Replaced the FeaturedProducts section with a "SHOP NOW" button:

```jsx
{/* Shop Now Section */}
<section className="w-full max-w-7xl animate-fade-in-up">
  <div className="text-center mb-8">
    <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-green-400 tracking-wide text-glow">
      Explore Our Collection
    </h3>
    <div className="w-24 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-green-500 to-transparent mx-auto"></div>
  </div>
  <div className="flex justify-center">
    <Link 
      href="/products" 
      className="group flex items-center gap-3 bg-gray-900 border-2 border-green-500 hover:bg-green-500/10 text-green-400 font-bold font-mono py-4 px-8 rounded-lg transition-all duration-300 hover-glow text-xl md:text-2xl"
    >
      <Terminal className="w-6 h-6 md:w-7 md:h-7 group-hover:animate-terminal-glow" />
      SHOP NOW
    </Link>
  </div>
</section>
```

### 2. Product Detail Page (app/products/[handle]/page.js)

- Added check to ensure params.handle is available before using it:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Ensure params.handle is available before using it
  if (!params || !params.handle) return;
  
  async function loadProduct() {
    // ...
  }

  loadProduct();
}, [params?.handle]);
```

## Notes

1. **Duplicate Color Picker Issue**
   - The issue description mentioned two sets of color pickers, but only one was found in the code
   - The color selection UI is implemented in lines 667-722 of the product details page
   - No other color selection UI was found that could be causing duplication

2. **Testing**
   - Changes have been reviewed for correctness
   - The homepage now displays a "SHOP NOW" button instead of featured products
   - The product details page now properly handles params.handle

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Changes in Browser**
   - Test the homepage to ensure the "SHOP NOW" button appears correctly
   - Test the product details page to ensure it loads correctly without errors
   - Check if there are any visual issues with the color picker that might have been missed in code review

2. **Monitor Error Logs**
   - Keep an eye on error logs to ensure the params.handle issue is fully resolved
   - Check for any other related errors that might appear
