# Debug Information Removal

## Issue Description

The featured product details and product page details were showing debug information that should not be visible to users. This debug information included:

1. Console logs with detailed product data
2. Debug sections in the product detail page
3. Error handling logs for image loading failures

## Changes Made

### 1. Conditional Debug Information

Updated all debug information to only show in development mode using the `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` check:

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('Debug information here');
}
```

### 2. Console Log Statements

Modified all console.log statements in the product detail page to only execute in development mode:

- Product data logging
- Variant selection logging
- Image loading and error handling
- Add to cart operations

### 3. Debug Section in UI

The product detail page already had a debug section that was conditionally rendered:

```javascript
{/* Debug Information - Only visible in development */}
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
  <div className="space-y-3 border-t border-yellow-400/30 pt-6 mt-6">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-300">Debug Information</h3>
    <div className="bg-gray-900/50 border border-yellow-400/20 rounded-lg p-4 text-xs font-mono">
      {/* Debug content here */}
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

This ensures that the debug section is only visible during development and not in production.

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users no longer see debug information that is meant for developers
2. **Cleaner Console**: Production environment has a clean console without development logs
3. **Maintained Debugging Capability**: Developers can still access debug information in development mode
4. **Better Security**: Sensitive information about the application structure is not exposed in production

## Testing

To verify these changes:

1. **Development Mode**: Run the application in development mode (`npm run dev`) and verify that debug information is still visible to developers
2. **Production Mode**: Build and run the application in production mode (`npm run build && npm start`) and verify that no debug information is visible to users

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Review**: Review other components for any remaining debug information
2. **Logging Strategy**: Consider implementing a more robust logging strategy for production errors
3. **Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries to gracefully handle errors in production
