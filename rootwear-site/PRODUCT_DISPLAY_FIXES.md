# Product Display Fixes

## Issues Addressed

1. **Featured Product Images Not Showing**
   - Featured product details were not showing images
   - Product detail pages were not displaying images
   - Products were incorrectly showing as "out of stock"

2. **Debug Information Displayed**
   - Products page was showing debug information before completely loading
   - Error states contained sensitive configuration information

## Root Causes

1. **Image Property Inconsistency**
   - The Shopify API returns image URLs with the property name `url`
   - Some parts of the code expected `src` property
   - Inconsistent property handling across components

2. **Availability Status Logic**
   - Inconsistent handling of `availableForSale` property
   - Some code used `|| false` fallback which defaulted to "out of stock"
   - Other code used `!== false` which defaulted to "in stock"

3. **Debug Information Exposure**
   - Debug code was left in production components
   - Environment variable information was displayed during loading and errors

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Debug Information Display

- **Products Page**
  - Removed debug information collection and display
  - Removed console.log statements
  - Replaced debug information in loading state with a spinner
  - Cleaned up error state to show only relevant information

### 2. Improved API Routes

- **Featured Products API Route**
  - Updated availability status logic to use `availableForSale !== false`
  - This ensures products are considered available unless explicitly marked as unavailable

- **Products API Route**
  - Added data transformation to ensure consistent availability status
  - Added handling to ensure images have both `url` and `src` properties
  - Ensured featuredImage has both `url` and `src` properties

### 3. Consistent Image Property Handling

- Ensured all image objects have both `url` and `src` properties
- Added fallbacks for image display in components
- Used `image.url || image.src` pattern for consistent access

### 4. Improved Availability Status Logic

- Used consistent `availableForSale !== false` pattern
- This ensures products are considered available unless explicitly marked as unavailable
- Matches the logic in the product detail page

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Product images now display correctly on all pages
   - Products show correct availability status
   - No debug information is visible to users

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Removed exposure of environment variable information
   - Cleaned up error states to show only necessary information

3. **Better Code Consistency**
   - Consistent handling of image properties
   - Consistent availability status logic
   - Improved error handling

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:

1. Featured products display images correctly
2. Product detail pages show images properly
3. Products show correct availability status
4. No debug information is displayed during loading or errors
5. API routes handle data consistently

## Next Steps

1. **Consider Adding Image Optimization**
   - Implement responsive images with multiple sizes
   - Add lazy loading for better performance

2. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add more robust error boundaries
   - Implement retry logic for API failures

3. **Improve Testing**
   - Add automated tests for product display
   - Test with various product configurations
