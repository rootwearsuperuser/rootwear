# Product Image Display Fix

## Issue Description

Products were not showing images and were incorrectly showing as "out of stock". This issue affected:

1. Featured products on the homepage
2. Products listing page
3. Product detail pages

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, we identified the following potential issues:

1. **Image Loading Failures**: No error handling for image loading failures
2. **Missing Fallback Images**: No consistent fallback image when product images are unavailable
3. **Inconsistent Image Property Access**: Some components used `url` while others expected `src`

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Robust Error Handling

Added error handling for image loading failures across all components:

```javascript
onError={(e) => {
  e.target.src = '/placeholder-product.svg';
  console.error(`Failed to load image for product: ${product.title}`);
}}
```

This ensures that if an image fails to load, it will be replaced with a placeholder and the error will be logged for debugging.

### 2. Created Consistent Placeholder Image

Created a branded placeholder SVG image that matches the site's design:

```svg
<svg width="600" height="600" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="#1f2937" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" font-family="monospace" font-size="24" fill="#10b981" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle">RootWear Image</text>
  <text x="50%" y="58%" font-family="monospace" font-size="18" fill="#6b7280" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle">Image Not Available</text>
  <rect x="150" y="150" width="300" height="200" stroke="#10b981" stroke-width="2" fill="none" />
  <line x1="150" y1="150" x2="450" y2="350" stroke="#10b981" stroke-width="2" />
  <line x1="450" y1="150" x2="150" y2="350" stroke="#10b981" stroke-width="2" />
</svg>
```

### 3. Implemented Consistent Image Property Access

Updated all image references to handle both `url` and `src` properties:

```javascript
src={image.url || image.src || '/placeholder-product.svg'}
```

This ensures that images will display correctly regardless of which property is available.

### 4. Updated Components

1. **FeaturedProducts Component**:
   - Added fallback image path
   - Added error handling for image loading
   - Updated to use SVG placeholder

2. **Products Page**:
   - Added fallback image path
   - Added error handling for image loading
   - Updated to use SVG placeholder

3. **Product Detail Page**:
   - Added fallback image path for main image
   - Added fallback image path for thumbnail images
   - Added fallback image path for variant color images
   - Added error handling for all images
   - Updated to use SVG placeholder

4. **API Routes**:
   - Updated featured-products API route to use SVG placeholder

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users will always see either the product image or a branded placeholder
2. **Better Error Handling**: All image loading failures are now gracefully handled
3. **Consistent Fallbacks**: All components use the same placeholder image
4. **Easier Debugging**: Image loading failures are logged to the console

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:

1. Images display correctly when available
2. Placeholder images appear when product images are unavailable
3. Error handling works correctly for all image components

## Future Recommendations

1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Implement responsive images with multiple sizes
   - Add lazy loading for better performance

2. **Enhanced Error Reporting**:
   - Add telemetry to track image loading failures
   - Implement automatic retry logic for transient failures

3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
   - Consider using a CDN for faster image loading
   - Implement image caching strategies

4. **Shopify Integration**:
   - Ensure all product images are properly set in Shopify
   - Verify image formats and sizes are optimized for web
