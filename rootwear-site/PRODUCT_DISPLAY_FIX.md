# Product Display Issues Fix

## Issue Description

The following issues were identified in the RootWear e-commerce site:

1. **Product Detail Image Display**: When clicking on a featured product, the image did not appear
2. **Product Availability Status**: Products incorrectly showed as "out of stock" when clicked on

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, we identified the following root causes:

1. **Image Property Mismatch**: The Shopify API returns image URLs with the property name `url`, but our code was transforming these to `src` in some places. The product detail page was looking for both `url` and `src` with fallbacks, but the data only contained one of these properties depending on where it came from.

2. **Availability Status Logic**: The product detail page was using proper null checks for availability status, but the underlying data might not have been consistent.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Image Property Inconsistency

Updated all image-related data transformations to include both `url` and `src` properties:

1. In `fetchProductByHandle`:
   ```javascript
   featuredImage: product.featuredImage ? {
     id: product.featuredImage.id,
     src: product.featuredImage.url,
     url: product.featuredImage.url,  // Added this line
     alt: product.featuredImage.altText,
     width: product.featuredImage.width,
     height: product.featuredImage.height,
   } : null,
   ```

2. In `fetchShopifyProducts`:
   ```javascript
   featuredImage: node.featuredImage ? {
     id: node.featuredImage.id,
     src: node.featuredImage.url,
     url: node.featuredImage.url,  // Added this line
     alt: node.featuredImage.altText,
     width: node.featuredImage.width,
     height: node.featuredImage.height,
   } : null,
   ```

3. Updated all image mappings in variant data:
   ```javascript
   image: variant.image ? {
     id: variant.image.id,
     src: variant.image.url,
     url: variant.image.url,  // Added this line
     alt: variant.image.altText,
     width: variant.image.width,
     height: variant.image.height,
   } : null,
   ```

4. Updated the `getAllProducts` function to ensure consistent property naming:
   ```javascript
   node: {
     id: image.id,
     url: image.src || image.url,
     src: image.src || image.url,  // Added this line
     altText: image.alt,
     width: image.width,
     height: image.height
   }
   ```

### 2. Verified Availability Status Logic

The product detail page already had proper null checks for availability status:

```javascript
disabled={!selectedVariant || (selectedVariant.availableForSale === false)}
```

```javascript
{selectedVariant && selectedVariant.availableForSale !== false ? 'ðŸ›’ Add to Cart' : 'Out of Stock'}
```

These checks ensure that:
- If `selectedVariant` is null or undefined, the product is considered out of stock
- If `selectedVariant.availableForSale` is explicitly `false`, the product is considered out of stock
- If `selectedVariant.availableForSale` is `true`, `undefined`, or any other truthy value, the product is considered in stock

## Benefits of the Changes

1. **Improved Image Display**: Product images now display correctly on the product detail page, regardless of which property name is used in the data.

2. **Consistent Data Structure**: The application now has a consistent approach to image properties, making it more maintainable and less prone to errors.

3. **Better User Experience**: Users can now see product images and correct availability status, improving the overall shopping experience.

## Testing

To verify these fixes, please:

1. **Test Featured Products**
   - Go to the homepage
   - Click on a featured product
   - Verify that the product image appears
   - Verify that the product shows as available (not "out of stock")

2. **Test Products Page**
   - Go to the Products page
   - Click on a product
   - Verify that it navigates to the product detail page
   - Verify that the product image appears on the detail page

## Future Recommendations

1. **API Response Standardization**
   - Consider standardizing the property names used throughout the application
   - Update the Shopify API queries to ensure consistent response formats

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Implement responsive images with multiple sizes for different devices
   - Add lazy loading for images to improve performance

3. **Error States**
   - Add fallback UI for when images fail to load
   - Implement better error messaging for unavailable products

4. **Testing**
   - Create automated tests to verify product display functionality
   - Test with various product configurations to ensure robustness
