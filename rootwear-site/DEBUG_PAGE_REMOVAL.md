# Debug Page Removal

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Debug Page**
   - Deleted the debug-shopify page directory and its contents
   - This page was previously used for testing Shopify API connections
   - The page is no longer needed as the main application is now functioning correctly

2. **Verified No Dependencies**
   - Confirmed that no other files in the project were importing or referencing the debug page
   - No navigation links were pointing to the debug page
   - Removal of this page has no impact on the rest of the application

3. **Tested Application Integrity**
   - Verified that the shopify.js file is syntactically correct
   - Confirmed that the products page still functions properly
   - Ensured that removing the debug page didn't break any existing functionality

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Codebase**
   - Removed unnecessary code that was only used for debugging
   - Simplified the project structure
   - Reduced potential security risks from exposing API credentials in the debug page

2. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Fewer files to maintain and update
   - Clearer separation between production code and development tools
   - Better focus on core application functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Consider Adding Proper Logging**
   - Instead of a debug page, implement proper logging for API calls
   - This would provide better visibility into issues without exposing a debug interface

2. **Implement Comprehensive Testing**
   - Add automated tests for the Shopify integration
   - This would provide more reliable verification than manual debug pages
