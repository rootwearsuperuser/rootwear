# Next.js Image Component Fix

## Issue Description

When clicking on featured products or product detail pages, the following error was encountered:

```
Error: next_image__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.default is not a constructor
```

## Root Cause

The error was caused by a compatibility issue with the Next.js Image component in version 15.4.5. In newer versions of Next.js, the way the Image component is imported and used has changed. The error occurs because the code was trying to use the Image component as a constructor, but the default export is not a constructor in the current version.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Image Import Syntax

Changed the import statement in all files using the Next.js Image component from:

```javascript
import Image from 'next/image';
```

to:

```javascript
import { default as NextImage } from 'next/image';
```

This ensures that we're using the correct import syntax for Next.js 15.4.5.

### 2. Updated Component Usage

Updated all instances of the `Image` component to use `NextImage` instead:

```javascript
<Image
  src={imageUrl}
  alt={imageAlt}
  width={width}
  height={height}
/>
```

to:

```javascript
<NextImage
  src={imageUrl}
  alt={imageAlt}
  width={width}
  height={height}
/>
```

### 3. Files Modified

The following files were updated:

1. `app/products/[handle]/page.js` - Product detail page
2. `app/components/FeaturedProducts.js` - Featured products component
3. `app/cart/page.js` - Cart page
4. `app/components/ProductGrid.js` - Product grid component

## Benefits

1. **Fixed Error**: The error "next_image__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.default is not a constructor" is now resolved.
2. **Improved Compatibility**: The code now works correctly with Next.js 15.4.5.
3. **Consistent Approach**: All components now use the same import syntax for the Image component.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify that the product detail pages and featured products now load correctly without errors.
2. **Documentation**: Update any development documentation to note the correct way to import and use the Next.js Image component.
3. **Consider Upgrading**: If possible, consider upgrading to a stable version of Next.js to avoid compatibility issues.
