# Shopify.js Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **API Version Inconsistency**
   - The shopify.js file was using '2023-10' as a fallback API version
   - The .env.local file specified '2024-01' as the API version
   - The debug-shopify page was hardcoding '2023-04' as the API version

2. **Code Duplication**
   - API routes were duplicating Shopify API logic instead of using the shopify.js file
   - This created potential for inconsistencies in how data is fetched and processed

## Changes Made

1. **Updated API Version in shopify.js**
   - Changed the fallback API version from '2023-10' to '2024-01' to match the environment variable
   - This ensures consistent API version usage across the application

2. **Fixed debug-shopify Page**
   - Updated to use the environment variable for API version instead of hardcoded value
   - Modified the Configuration section to display the correct API version
   - This ensures the debug page accurately reflects the current configuration

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Consistency**
   - All parts of the application now use the same API version
   - This prevents potential compatibility issues with the Shopify API

2. **Maintainability**
   - Using environment variables makes it easier to update the API version in one place
   - The debug page now accurately reflects the current configuration

## Testing Results

The changes have been tested for syntax errors:

1. **shopify.js**
   - Syntax check completed without errors
   - API version fallback updated successfully to '2024-01'

2. **debug-shopify/page.js**
   - Syntax check completed without errors
   - Environment variable usage for API version implemented correctly
   - Configuration display updated to show the correct API version

## Future Recommendations

1. **Refactor API Routes**
   - Consider refactoring API routes to use the shopify.js utility functions
   - This would reduce code duplication and ensure consistent data handling

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test all Shopify-related functionality after API version changes
   - Ensure that product fetching, cart operations, and checkout processes work correctly

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement more robust error handling for Shopify API calls
   - Add retry logic for transient network issues

4. **Caching**
   - Consider implementing caching for Shopify API responses to improve performance
   - Use stale-while-revalidate pattern for optimal user experience
