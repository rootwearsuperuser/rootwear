# Environment Variables Fix

## Issue Description

The products page and featured products were showing the error "Shopify configuration missing" when running the development server. This occurred because the environment variables containing the Shopify credentials were not being properly loaded by Next.js.

## Root Cause

Next.js looks for environment variables in `.env` files located in the project root directory. In this case, the `.env.local` file was placed in the parent directory (`rootwear`) instead of the Next.js project directory (`rootwear-site`), causing the environment variables to be unavailable to the application.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a new `.env.local` file in the correct location**
   - Added the file to the `rootwear-site` directory (the Next.js project root)
   - Included all necessary Shopify configuration variables:
     ```
     SHOPIFY_DOMAIN=7ejzby-xc.myshopify.com
     SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=57c943e11ae51d05d3bab373916a22c9
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-01
     ```

## Benefits of the Changes

1. **Fixed the immediate error**
   - The "Shopify configuration missing" error should no longer appear
   - The products page and featured products should now load correctly

2. **Proper Environment Variable Configuration**
   - Environment variables are now in the correct location for Next.js to access them
   - The application can securely access the Shopify credentials without hardcoding them

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Run the development server to verify that the error is resolved
   - Check that both the products page and featured products load correctly

2. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Consider using a more comprehensive environment variable management approach
   - Add documentation about environment variable setup to the project README
   - Ensure that `.env.local` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent credentials from being committed to version control
